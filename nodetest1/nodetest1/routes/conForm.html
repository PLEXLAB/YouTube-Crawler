	<h2>
		PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:
	</h2>
		Dr. William Hamilton<br>
		Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science<br>
		New Mexico State University<br>

	<h2>
		WHAT IS THE PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE OF THIS STUDY?
	</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of this study is to conduct a distributed investigation of the YouTube video platform's demonetization policies using an automated 
			browser extension tool. This information has the potential to inform understanding of the practices of content creators and the impacts of 
			platform policy updates. This understanding may inform the design of future systems.
		</p>	
		<p>
			If you choose to participate in this study, you will be asked to install a chrome extension built by the research team. The extension will 
			access your YouTube channel creator studio page and crawl the meta-data and the analytics of the videos you have published on your channel. When crawling, 
			the extension will open a minimized window in your browser, which automatically navigate through pages of the YouTube Studio pages for your 
			channel. Collected data will be stored in a secure server maintained by the research team, physically located at NMSU. Collected data will 
			be destroyed 5 years after the completion of the study.
		</p>
	<h2>
		WHY ARE WE ASKING YOU TO PARTICIPATE FOR THIS STUDY?
	</h2>
		<p>
			You are being asked to participate in this study because you are content creator on one or more social media platforms.
		</p>
	<h2>
		ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THIS STUDY?
	</h2>
		<p>
			It is important to let the Researcher(s) know if you are in another research study. You should discuss this with the Researcher(s) 
			before you agree to participate in another research study while you are in this study. 
		</p>
	<h2>
		WHAT IS THE DURATION?
	</h2>
	<p>
		The duration of the process crawling your YouTube channel will be based on the number of videos you have posted with approximation of 10 minutes.  
		The crawling process will happen periodically, every day, until the completion of the study. The study is scheduled to conclude January 31, 2021. 
		You may choose to uninstall the extension before that to stop the crawling process.
	</p>
	<h2>
		WHERE IS THE STUDY GOING TO TAKE PLACE? 
	</h2>
	<p>
		The research procedures will be conducted online. 	
	</p>
	<h2>
		WHAT IF NEW INFORMATION IS LEARNED DURING THE STUDY THAT MIGHT AFFECT YOUR DECISION TO PARTICIPATE?

	<p>
		You will be informed if the Researcher(s) learn new information that could change your mind about staying in the study. You may be asked to 
		sign a new informed consent form if the information is provided to you after you have joined the study.
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>	
		Otherwise, the Researcher(s) will make every effort to prevent anyone who is not on the research team from knowing that you gave us 
		information, or what that information is. You should know that there are some circumstances in which the Researcher(s) 
		may have to show your information to other people.
	</p>
	<p>
		Information collected in the process of this study will remain confidential. Researchers will follow the laws and regulations 
		regarding privacy practices in this domain. We will keep a copy of your contact information separate from study data in order to
		contact you for follow ups if needed. This will be destroyed along with all data 5 years after the completion of the study.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong><i>The findings and results of the study may appear publicly in journals, conferences, and other academic publications.</i></strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Your anonymized data may be shown to other users of the extension to help them understand the impact of platform policies at a later time.
	</p>
	<h2>
		TRANSPERANCY
	</h2>
	<p>
		Participants can view the source code for the study extension at the code repository here: <a href="https://github.com/PLEXLAB/youTube-Crawler">
		https://github.com/PLEXLAB/youTube-Crawler</a>. 
		A readme file explaining the installation of the extension will be provided upon request. Also, the extension provides access to your 
		collected data and a webpage enabling you to withdraw from the study. The extension will be maintained in order to fix bugs, enhance performance, and maintain compatiblity software updates. 
		Also, new features might be added, in which case you will be notified to agree to new terms.
	</p>
	<h2>
		WHERE WILL INFORMATION BE STORED AND FOR HOW LONG?
	</h2>

		The information will be stored in a password protected digital repository, physically located on the New Mexico State University campus. 
		Physical records will be stored in Science Hall Rooms 147 and 150 at New Mexico State University. Data records will be kept for 5 years, 
		at which time they will be destroyed.
