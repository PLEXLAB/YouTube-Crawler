Message to Saleem and Dr. Hamilton.

Bit of warning, towards the end of this project
I learned request to servers can be a bit out of sync
with code execution. Given more time and with the knowledge
I learned from Modern Web Technologies, I would've refactored
my server request methods and strayed away from raw ajax requests,
made better use of chrome's messaging system, and implemented 
XMLHttpRequest where I couldve had more control of listening to server 
states and provided minor UI feedback on:

-successful/failed account authentication
-extension badges to indicate requests for re logins (to refresh auth tokens)
-extension badges to indicate if reports were successful to post for the day

Other than that thank you for letting me be a part of this project!
I hope my findings and this extension tool will help you in your
research.
